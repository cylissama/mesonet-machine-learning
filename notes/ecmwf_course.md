###### ECMWF MOOC Machine Learning in Weather & Climate Course

# Tier 1 - ML in Weather & Climate

### Introduction to ML in Weather & Climate

Numerical weather prediction
- the model 
- the observations
- the supercomputer

1. collect the observations
2. data assimilation
3. forecast models
3. product generation

Full Earth System
- ocean, land, atmosphere

Model development
- constantly updated
- large mesh of data

Ensemble forecast

Climate mongering capabilities, flood forecasting, risk of forest fire, atmospheric conditions

Q: why machine learning?
- detecting outliers and problems within existing methods and datasets
- improve forecasting
- make models for specific data
- these models can recognize complex relationships not clearly identified by humans
- automate time sensitive tasks
- detect climate events in real time
- emulate missing variables

#### What is Machine Learning and what types are there?

1. Supervised Learning
- data with labels

2. Unsupervised Learning
- clustering
- reduced complexity of data

3. Semi-Supervised Learning
- relies on partially labeled datasets

4. Reinforcement Learning
- define rules, reward correct choices

#### Why should we consider Machine Learning for weather and climate modelling?

##### Improve understanding
- causal discovery
- uncertainty quantification
- fuse information from different datasets

##### Speed up simulations and green computing
- emulate model components
- port emulators to heterogenous hardware
- data compression
- optimize workload

##### Improve weather and climate models
- learn components from observations
- correct biases
- quality control
- feature detection

##### Link communities
- linking different datasets to map them together

#### Challenges for Machine Learning in weather and climate modelling

- too much data, 800 million daily observations
- machine learning systems have to work reliably within th existing forecasting systems
- ensure machine learning systems are robust and will be ok to change in the future

### Observations

1. Data in NWP

### Concept and state-of-the-art

#### Earth System Models
- predict weather up to a month ahead

##### 5 Ingredients to earth system model

1. Equations
2. Grid-points
3. Discretization
4. Supercomputer
5. Sub-grid-scale parametrization schemes

### Forecasting with ML

#### Approached to using ML

1. _Acceleration_ - computational saving and increase model complexity for larger models
2. _Model Improvement_ - replacing existing weather forecast models

Both can lead to improvements in forecast quality
